# horiseon-refactoring
The previous Horiseon code had some issues dealing with the way the HTML was written semantically and also the way the CSS was repeated,

To begin with I changed the Title to catch a users eye because it deals with skills to improve a company

Next i removed as many divs as i could and put the correct tags for example; the footer and aside tags were self explanatory so i switched those than i also put athe nav tag inside my header tag because it allows users to go to a section of the article which is why i put section tag outside of the article

after the HTML formatting i than moved onto the CSS and i realized alot of code was repeating so i reorganized the classes to be the same for certain ones like S.E.O and S.M.M, for online reputation i did not because if i gave it the same attributes it would break the site which is not what we want 

I than gave the aside sections the same classes and after that i gave it the same CSS attributes for that class and kept the site the same way it looked 

One of the final things i did was organize the CSS structure in sequential order because after all the work that was done i realized everything was jumbled together and commented waht each CSS action does to the site
